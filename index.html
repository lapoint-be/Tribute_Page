    <h2> A Brief History of Crashing Boats </h2>
    <h4> The goal is to land a smaller boat in the hot tub by ramming the back of the yacht </h4>
    <section class="contain">
      <div class="one">
        <p> Despite how impressive this looks, I can't take full credit for parking my boat this way. Initially I was parked as the second example on this page, but the yacht
        switched out and in the small time that neither yacht truly existed my boat settled down to where it rests in this picture. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="imgone">

      </div>
      <div class="two">
        <p> I was hopeful for this jump to be the one to finally land into the hot tub located just above the flag. Unfortunately, I ended up hitting this vertical section and wedging
        myself fairly badly into this space between the canopies. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="three">
        <p> I was so proud of this jump that I just had to get pictures from several angles. On top of the boat is my friend who happened to own the yacht I was ramming with
        <em> his </em> boat. I missed the hot tub by a fair margin but I managed to <em> accidentally </em> destroy his helicopter. </p>

      </div>
      <div class="four">
        <p> Here is a second angle of my best jump so far. As you can see, the hot tub is the floor below me currently. It seems that either I can't get the boat angled
        properly to get higher than the first level, or I get too much angle and fall over the side or land on a helipad. </p>
